#  Unprotected Admin Functionality   

**Category**: 01-Broken-Access-Control  
**Lab_ID**: Unprotected-Admin-Panel-001  
**Source**: PortSwigger   
**Date_Completed**: 2025-10-01  
**Tag**: `Broken-Access-Control`, `Admin-Panel`, `Info-Disclosure`, `Robots.txt`  


## Executive summary

An administrative interface was disclosed via `robots.txt` and exposed without any authentication or authorization checks. This allowed an unauthenticated user to access the admin panel and perform destructive administrative actions — specifically, deleting the `carlos` user account. The issue demonstrates broken access control and information disclosure and represents a high-impact vulnerability for applications that rely on secrecy of endpoints rather than proper access controls.

**Result:** Admin panel path discovered in `robots.txt` → accessed directly → deleted user `carlos`.
**Severity (subjective):** High — allows unauthenticated administrative actions.
**Recommended immediate action:** Restrict access to admin endpoints and implement server-side authentication + authorization checks.

---

## Objective

Locate any administrative interface disclosed by the application, verify whether it is protected, and if unprotected, demonstrate the impact by removing the user account `carlos`.

---

## Environment & tools

* Target: PortSwigger lab instance (Apprentice difficulty).
* Tools: Modern browser and developer tools; Burp Suite used optionally to capture/inspect requests.
* Notes: No credentials were required to access the admin panel.

---

## Discovery (how the admin interface was found)

1. Requested `/robots.txt` from the application root.
2. `robots.txt` contained a `Disallow:` line revealing the admin path (e.g., `/administrator-panel`).
3. Navigating to the disclosed path loaded an administrative interface without authentication or authorization checks.

> Finding: `robots.txt` is an information-disclosure vector — it exposed a sensitive path that should not be relied on for security.

---

## Reproduction steps (concise, non-sensitive)

1. Open the application base URL in a browser.
2. Append `/robots.txt` to the URL and examine contents for `Disallow` entries.
3. Note the admin path listed (example: `/administrator-panel`).
4. Replace `/robots.txt` in the URL with the disclosed admin path and navigate to it.
5. In the admin UI, locate the user management area, identify user `carlos`, and invoke the delete action.
6. Verify the user is no longer listed or that the UI returns a successful deletion confirmation.

**Representative HTTP interaction (illustrative only):**

```
GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: <target>

GET /administrator-panel HTTP/1.1
Host: <target>

POST /administrator-panel/users/delete HTTP/1.1
Host: <target>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=carlos
```

## Observed impact

* Unauthenticated user can perform administrative operations (delete accounts).
* Integrity and availability of user data are compromised.
* Potential for escalated malicious actions: data exfiltration, privilege changes, account takeover, or system disruption.
* If similar patterns exist for other endpoints, the entire administrative surface could be exploited by any unauthenticated actor.

---

## Root cause analysis

* **Primary cause:** Admin functionality is accessible without authentication/authorization enforcement on the server side.
* **Secondary cause / contributing factor:** Sensitive path disclosed in `robots.txt`. While `robots.txt` itself is not a vulnerability, disclosing admin paths there increases the ease of discovery for attackers. The fundamental issue is missing or incorrect access control on admin endpoints.

---

## Risk assessment

* **Likelihood:** Medium — admin paths are easily discoverable via `robots.txt`, crawlers, or simple enumeration.
* **Impact:** High — attacker-controlled deletion of user accounts and other destructive admin actions.
* **Overall risk:** High.
  Optionally map to CVSS: a preliminary estimate would likely fall into the **High** range depending on exact scopes and authentication contexts (e.g., CVSS base score ~7–9).

## Remediation (recommended, prioritized)

### Immediate / short-term (apply within hours)

1. Remove administrative URLs from `robots.txt` and any public sitemaps or disclosures.
2. If feasible, restrict admin endpoints to internal IP ranges or via network-level controls while permanent fixes are applied.

### Medium-term (apply within days)

1. **Enforce authentication**: Require authenticated sessions for any admin pages. Use strong authentication (password + MFA where appropriate).
2. **Enforce server-side authorization**: Validate user role/privileges on every admin endpoint and action; do not rely on client-side controls or obscurity.
3. **CSRF protection**: Ensure all state-changing admin requests are protected against CSRF (e.g., anti-CSRF tokens validated server-side).
4. **Use least privilege**: Ensure admin accounts are minimal and database users used by the application have restricted permissions.

### Long-term / defensive controls

1. Implement RBAC (role-based access control) with audit logging for admin operations.
2. Add monitoring and alerts for admin-panel access and high-risk actions (account deletions, privilege changes).
3. Add automated tests and CI checks ensuring admin endpoints return 401/403 to unauthenticated requests.
4. Periodic access reviews and penetration testing focused on access control.

---

## Detection & verification guidance (for devs / QA / security teams)

* Verify that admin routes return `401` or `403` for unauthenticated requests.
* Ensure UI-only protections are not relied upon; validate server-side enforcement by simulating unauthenticated requests and attempting actions.
* Scan repository and deployment artifacts for endpoints like `/admin`, `/administrator`, `/dashboard`, etc., and check their access controls.
* Add an automated CI smoke test: attempt a known admin endpoint without credentials and assert it is blocked.

---

## Suggested tests to add

* Integration test: unauthenticated `GET /administrator-panel` returns `401/403`.
* Integration test: unauthenticated `POST /administrator-panel/users/delete` returns `401/403` (and does not remove users).
* Role test: authenticated non-admin user cannot access admin endpoints or perform admin actions.
* Logging test: admin actions create an audit record (user, timestamp, action).

## Notes & lessons learned

* `robots.txt` can be helpful for enumeration; treat it as a source of potential sensitive-path discovery during threat modeling and testing.
* Proper access control and strong authentication are non-negotiable for admin surfaces; hiding endpoints is insufficient.
* Implement layered defenses (network restrictions + authentication + authorization + logging).

---

## Evidence & validation (for lab record)

* `robots.txt` contained a `Disallow` entry for the admin path.
* Admin UI accessible without prior authentication.
* Successful deletion of `carlos` verified via admin UI state change / success response.
